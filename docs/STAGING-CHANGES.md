# Staging change log

Changes made to `partnership-doinggoodleeds-org-uk-stg.wordifysites.com`
(`01KZ9TYGCG3CF0WVX8VX736BNG`). Production is untouched throughout.

| When | Change | State now |
|---|---|---|
| 14 Sep | SmartCache `exclude_urls` set to `/dashboard`, `/wp-login.php`, `/wp-admin`, `/wp-json` | applied |
| 14 Sep | Server cron enabled at 5 min | **reverted by Martin**, now off, interval left at 5 |

Reads only, no change: `wp option get theme_mods_blocksy-child` (brand palette),
`wp post list` / `wp post get` (logo attachments).

Production, for comparison: same cache exclusions applied; server cron still off
at 15 min, because enabling it was refused by the permission layer.

## Blocked

**Cannot deploy the plugin to staging.** `martingfisher/dglp-platform` is private,
so the site's `wp plugin install <github zip>` gets a 404. Wordify's
`install_plugin` only accepts wp.org slugs, and `wp eval`, `wp shell` and
`wp config` are blocked, so there is no file-write route from here.

Options, all needing a decision: make the repo public, put a deploy key on the
server, SFTP a zip by hand, or use Wordify's own git deploy if it has one.
Not doing any of these unilaterally.

Until one is in place, WordPress-facing code is lint-clean but unexecuted.
Everything in `tests/run.php` is genuinely verified, because those layers are
deliberately free of WordPress.
